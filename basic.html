        <p> My name is Adam Gotkin, and I am from a suburb in Maryalnd just outside of <strong> Washington, DC. </strong> What I like to do for fun is pretty much the same as what I study. I am a <i> Broadcast and Digital Journalism </i> major who really just loves to watch and report on sports. I spend most of my weekends working at one of the on campus publications, whether that be CitrusTV, WAER, or Z89. </p>
        <p> I have one older brother, my mom and my dad in my family. We are all very close though I barely live at home and my brother is out of school and moved to Boston.

I also have a very old personal website that hasn't been touched since high school but is still <a href="https://adamgotkin24.wixsite.com/website"> fun to look at. </a></p>
